# JavaScript Concepts

### What Really Is JavaScript?

JS is a highly abstracted programming language.  
**Abstraction:** hiding the implementation details, showing only the functionality to the user.

JS collect garbage automatically.

JIT: Just-In-Time  
JS is not a purely interpreted language. Modern JS is JIT compiled. JIT compiler converts the entire code into machine code and execute them immediately.

JS is a multi-paradigm programming language.  
1. Procedural Programming
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Functional Programming  
  
JS is a proto-typed based programming language.  

JS is dynamically typed.  

**JavaScript:**  
- High Abstraction
- Garbage Collection
- JIT Compiled
- Multi-paradigm
- Prototyped-based
- Dynamically-typed
